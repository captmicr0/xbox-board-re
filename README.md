### Quick Notes
- Don't worry about the traces being 100% on point. This can be cleaned up in the future, both manually and via post processing once a DRC ruleset is established. It's more important that unrelated traces don't touch!
- Keep traces as seperate objects. Just make sure same net traces are touching.
- Keep tracing simple. Don't zoom in and create 20 points for a curve. Again, as long it's close enough we can fit it later with post processing.
- It's probably best for use to take turns and merge often.
- Be generous with traces overlapping pads.
- Don't worry about planes/fills right now.
- Vias and footprints will be created later with symbols.

Feel free to ask if you have any questions about the project, or how to use Inkscape.

### OpenCV Script
- Working on script to auto-detect traces, vias, pads, and designators.
